<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about">What is this?</h2>

Mosaicly is a location-based pixel art game for UCSC students who desperately need to touch grass but can't do so without opening Instagram for the 8th time today. The idea is that you walk around UCSC, find canvases stuck to lampposts and bathrooms, and drop pixels like a degenerate Banksy. The catch? You can only draw if you're _physically there_.

Imagine if Pokémon Go and r/place had an affair and our lawyers got custody. Instead of catching fake animals or sending threats to XQC, you drop pixel canvases across campus and force people to actually walk to them if they want to add anything.

<br>

<h2 id="why">Why does this exist?</h2>

UCSC is great — until it isn't. Freshmen cry in Porter. Transfers get lost in the woods. Socializing feels like a side quest that you never picked up.

The goal with Mosaicly is to give people something stupidly low-effort to bond over. You see a canvas. You scan it. You contribute. Maybe someone else does too. Now you’re both dumbasses who made a lopsided banana on a wall near Earth & Marine. Congrats — you’re now part of something.

- **You can slap canvases anywhere**: lamppost, vending machine, or a urinal.
- **You have to show up IRL** to edit. No couch contributions allowed.
- **It’s fast, lightweight, and works on your browser** — no install required.
- **It uses real-time updates, points, and unlocks** — because who doesn’t like pixels and XP.
    <!-- - **It’s fun and stupid**. Like most of UCSC demands. -->

It's probably not going to change your life. But it forces you to go outside and potentially meet people that you can talk to. That’s good enough for us.

<br>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

1. **Make a canvas**: You pick a location. We give you a QR code.
2. **Put it somewhere**: Print out the QR code (or just get it into the real world somehow), and stick it somewhere semi-legal.
3. **Someone sees it**: They scan the code.
4. **They want to edit it**: Gotta be there in person. That's the whole point.
5. **You place a pixel**: You get XP. Maybe it unlocks stuff. Maybe it just feeds our engagement metrics. Don’t worry about it.

<br>

<h2 id="contribute">Contributing</h2>

This project is held together by duct tape, Supabase, and whatever free time we had between crying over CSE assignments and research projects.

If for some reason you want to contribute, here's what you can do:

- Open an issue if something’s broken.
- Suggest a feature that makes things better or worse. We take both.
- Fork it and PR your mess. We might even merge it.
- Star the repo if you like meaningless internet points.

<br>

<h2 id="contacts">Contact us (or don't)</h2>

We don't have an official email yet, but we do have a Discord server:
